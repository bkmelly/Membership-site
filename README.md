# Membership Site Backend Development

## **Progress Checkpoints**
### **Date: 2024-11-22**

### **Completed**
- **Backend Server**: Successfully set up the Node.js server using Express.js.
- **MongoDB Connection**: Configured MongoDB and connected successfully.
- **User Authentication**:
  - Created endpoints for user registration (`/api/users/register`) and login (`/api/users/login`).
  - JWT tokens generated upon successful login.
- **Basic Middleware**: Included basic error handling and token verification middleware.
-**Testing Route Authentication**:
   Tested `/api/users/register` and `/api/users/login` using Postman.
- **Frontend Integration**:
   Frontend-to-backend API calls using `fetch` or `axios` are pending.

### **Current Checkpoint**

- **Dashboard Security**:
  - JWT token verification for protecting dashboard routes still needs to be implemented.
  - Redirection to dashboard after login

---

### **Pending Features**
1. **Email Verification**:
   - Use `nodemailer` to send verification emails to users during registration.
   - Implement a route to verify user email addresses and activate accounts.

2. **Authentication Enhancements (Optional)**:
   - Integrate Passport.js only if extending to support OAuth (e.g., Google, Facebook).
   - Stick to the current JWT-based authentication for simplicity and consistency.

3. 
4. **Finalize Security**:
   - Implement JWT token-based protection for all restricted routes.

---

### **Known Issues**
1. loging in , unable to post form data 
---

### **Next Steps**
1. Debug and fix the 500 error on authentication routes.
<!-- 2. Proceed with frontend-backend integration.
3. Secure the dashboard route with JWT token verification middleware. -->
4. Implement email verification using `nodemailer`.
